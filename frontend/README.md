# Base Mini App Demo

A demo [mini app](https://miniapps.farcaster.xyz) to demonstrate the functionality available for mini app developers in [Base App](https://base.app).

Note: this Base Mini App Demo used to live [here](https://github.com/Vicolee/frames-v2-demo) and was recently moved to this `base/demos` repo so it can be more easily found

## Getting Started

This is a [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) + TypeScript + React app.

To install dependencies:

```bash
$ yarn
```

To run the app:

```bash
$ yarn dev
```

To test your mini app in Farcaster's playground or in Base App, you'll want to use a tunneling tool like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/)
